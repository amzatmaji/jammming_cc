This project is a mini react web application, built for practice purposes.

I used my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

The application will be version controlled with git and hosted on github 


Features: Users can search for songs by song title or other attributes like artist’s name, genre, etc.
Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account
